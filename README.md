[live site here](https://brianlovega.github.io/weather-vanilla-js/)

weather app using vanilla js html and css

Similiar to the one I have on my simple over complex site

Weather app using [open weather map api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Simply type city name into search box

and press enter or forecast me button.

So upon adding a button it has a kind of auto try when you are typing so it will fetch as you type.

Nothing like turning a bug into a feature.

Enjoy the day regardless of the weather.
